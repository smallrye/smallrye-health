= Health Registry

A health registry provides a way to register the health checks programatically. It also allows
to remove the programatically registered health checks when they are no longer needed. This presents
an option to dynamically register and unregister health checks based on the user defined criteria.

== Health Registry usage

The `HealthRegistry` can be injected as a CDI bean with `@Liveness` or `@Readiness` qualifiers:

[source,java]
----
@Inject
@Liveness
HealthRegistry livenessHealthRegistry;

@Inject
@Readiness
HealthRegistry readinessHealthRegistry;
----

NOTE: Health group registry have not been requested as of yet but if some applications would find
it useful please raise a new issue in the https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-health/issues[SmallRye Health issue tracker].

You can then register your health check by simple calling the `register` methods:

[source,java]
----
public void register() {
    livenessHealthRegistry.register(new TestLiveness()); <1>
}

public void registerReady() {
    readinessHealthRegistry.register("dynamic-readiness", new TestReadiness()); <2>
}
----
<1> If no user defined name is provided during registration the health check is registered as
`TestLiveness.class.getName()`
<2> The user provided name `dynamic-readiness` will be used as the check identificator

To unregister the registered health check you can call the `remove` methods:

[source,java]
----
public void remove() {
    livenessHealthRegistry.remove(TestLiveness.class.getName());
}

public void removeReady() {
    readinessHealthRegistry.remove("dynamic-readiness");
}
----
