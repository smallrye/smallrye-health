= Wellness

The wellness is another health groups besides the liveness and readiness that can be standardized
as a group of health checks that don't belong to either liveness (application restart) or
readiness (traffic discards) but have a value for any post processing automatic or manual
health monitoring.

== The @Wellness annotation

You can use the `@Wellness` annotation in a similar manner as `@Readiness` or `@Liveness`:

[source,java]
----
@Wellness <1>
@ApplicationScoped
public class WellnessCheck implements HealthCheck {
    @Override
    public HealthCheckResponse call() {
        return HealthCheckResponse.up("wellness-check");
    }
}
----
<1> The `@Wellness` qualifier

== Accessing the wellness checks

The wellness checks are exposed under the `/health/well` endpoint. They are also available
at grouped `/health` endpoint together with all other health checks (liveness, readiness, and
health groups).
